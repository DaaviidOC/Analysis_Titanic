<h1>Titanic Dataset Analysis</h1> </br>

<p>This project showcases a Data Analyst exercise completed during my training at Upgrade Hub. It focuses on the exploration of the Titanic dataset, focusing on the factors that could have affected the survival of the passengers.</p>
 
[Upgrade Hub](https://www.upgrade-hub.com/) is an educational institution dedicated to offering high-quality training programs in technology and data science. </br>


## Project Contents
The project comprises three main components: </br>
- Data Files (CSV): This files contains all the data used in the analysis. It stores data about passengers with attributes such as age, gender, ticket, landing stage, cabin class and most crucially, whether they survived or not. </br>
- Jupyter Notebook: Here, you'll find the detailed analysis, including data processing, exploratory analysis, and visualization. The notebook is structured to guide you through each step of the analysis, with comments and explanations. </br>
- Python Script: [Script](https://titanicpy-ejuerwdjjz89ftgfqioyhl.streamlit.app/) that stores the Streamlit application.
- [Power BI Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMTRiNmI2YmItNDVjMy00MTM3LTljZWMtZmVkMWU3ZDNmMzBmIiwidCI6IjhhZWJkZGI2LTM0MTgtNDNhMS1hMjU1LWI5NjQxODZlY2M2NCIsImMiOjl9): Here you will find the Power BI dashboard for our Titanic dataset. 
- Conclusions: This document summarizes the key findings and insights derived from the data. It includes interpretations of the visualizations and the conclusions drawn from the analysis. </br>
